### Summary

RoboSight™ was developed by RoadNarrows Intelligent Systems in 2008. It is a small sensor module which includes a simple camera integrated with a CogniMem™ neural network chip for easy training and control applications. It can be used stand-alone or in conjunction with a controlling computer. The CogniMem™ neural network chip was developed by General Vision Inc. of Petaluma, CA. RoadNarrows developed a simple serial command-level embedded API to manage the CogniMem chip functions.

CogniBoost™ was developed by RoadNarrows as a computer peripheral module similar to RoboSight, but with a USB instead of a serial interface, and no camera. Instead, a host computer provides the data input, either from a camera or other types of data sets to feed to/from the CogniMem chip. Both products have full software API tools developed by RoadNarrows. In addition, [RoboRealm](http://www.roborealm.com) provided a high-level GUI interface to the two products. 


RoboSight and CogniBoost are discontinued and are no longer manufactured by RoadNarrows.
