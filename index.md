This is an image I took from Kennedy Space Center of SpaceX's first Falcon Heavy launch.



## About Me

Iâ€™m a technologist and entrepreneur living in Colorado. I love robotics, space, AI, cognitive science, machine vision, and product development. I take a systems engineering approach to design as well as business operations and project management. I love trail running, paddleboarding and the outdoors. I'm passionate about good food, health and world well-being.

I'm currently working in the eLearning industry at OpenSesame, a startup based out of Portland, Oregon. OpenSesame is an innovator in the global online learning space, developing technology platforms for small businesses and corporate clients around the world. 

Prior to OpenSesame I worked at AIRY3D, a wonderful small startup in Montreal which is developing innovative 3D sensor technology (and software) using a transmissive diffraction mask on classic CMOS. 

I was the co-founder of [RoadNarrows Robotics](https://roadnarrows-robotics.github.io), a small robotics company that developed software and hardware for robotics-related systems. We also provided 3rd party equipment such as sensors and robotics platforms for research and academia.RoadNarrows closed down all operations in Dec 2020. 


#### Mantra:

Dream as if you'll live forever. Live as if you'll die today.

#### Superpower:

Science is *my* Superpower
