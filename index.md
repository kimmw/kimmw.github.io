This is an image I took from Kennedy Space Center of SpaceX's recent Falcon Heavy launch.



## About Me

Iâ€™m a technologist and entrepreneur living in Colorado. I love robotics, space, AI, cognitive science, machine vision, and product development. I take a systems engineering approach to design as well as business operations and project management. I love trail running, paddleboarding and the outdoors. I'm passionate about good food, health and world well-being.


I'm the co-founder of [RoadNarrows Robotics](https://roadnarrows-robotics.github.io), a small robotics company developing software for robotics-related systems. We also provide sensors and robotics platforms for research and academia.


#### Mantra:

Dream as if you'll live forever. Live as if you'll die today.

#### Superpower:

Science is *my* Superpower
